It an e commerce website using html,css grid and javascript. I made this with the help of Udemy Instructor John Smilga.

It hits API provided by the instructor, fetch data from API and displays it in the front end. 
It als uses localStorage API, even if you reload the website cart data will not be lost.

it is responsive as well, works in each and every device of different screen sizes.
